# SigninStats

Azure AD signing logs can be sent to log analytics :)

On some tenants these logs can take up quite a bit of storage. 

This projects aims at consolidating those logs at some time interval to lower the storage needed.

Admitedly these don't replace the original logs but they can give a sense of the amount and type of signins on a tenant.
